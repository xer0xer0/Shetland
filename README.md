# About
Shetland is a OpenGL real time 3D renderer. It's a sandbox where I can experiment with and learn new lighting and rendering algorithms. While there is no set end product, there are topics I want to explore, so the architecture and GUI will lean towards those.

Shetland named after the Shetland pony. It's my mini work horse- testy, will bite when mad, can pull its weight, but is lighter than other graphics APIs.
